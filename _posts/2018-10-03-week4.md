A book with a list of all the (level 2 or higher) sex offenders in the state of Massachusetts registered after July 12, 2013, some blank pages, and an invitation to peruse and write in it.

I was thinking about the format of [Forgot Your Password](https://arambartholl.com/forgot-your-password/). I was interested in the notion of turning a digital data set into a physical, tangible object and re-contextualizing and re-presenting it and changing the conversation around it. I was playing with a few different data sets, and the ideas were playful in nature.

And then I spent two days listening to the Kavanaugh hearing. I called my mom and we talked about re-experiencing trauma.

I had trouble working through that- I spent a lot of time thinking about that hearing and I was having a hard time finding something to say about the dataset I was working with. I decided to look up the sex offender registries around the U.S. The interfaces for getting data in each state are different. Some have maps, some have complete lists, some require you to look up by address or by name. All of them don’t represent all the offenders who were never reported. There’s something about the “encyclopedia” format of Forgot Your Password that alludes to completeness. I wanted to take that format and acknowledge that it was incomplete. I want to give the object weight and sobriety, but not complete authority.

The resulting book has blank pages to indicate the incompleteness. Viewers are invited to pencil in whatever they choose, and some things have been penciled in. I chose Massachusetts sex offenders because I wanted my audience to have a personal connection to it. The names in the data sets were in all caps and last name first, and I reformatted the names to be first name first and with standard case so that it felt more personal and didn’t have the feeling of lookup in a database, but more that sort of analog lookup. The names are still alphabetized, but by first name.

I chose to use white pages and black text with a rounded, serif typeface (Georgia) because I wanted the book to be approachable and feel a bit “standard”. The small format is so that it is an intimate and individual experience with the book. The pencil versus the printed type alludes to power structures vs individual interventions.

I've been thinking about work that I made to work through things personally as work that also has a public-facing life. Making the work participatory and allowing it to be vandalized and criticized as part of the work made me more comfortable with it being done and considered over such a short period of time.
