title: Representation Matters, Too

![The "representation matters, too" zine. For the full description, continue on the page. The rest of its contents are the description. ](https://apurvaraman.github.io/img/rep.png)

## Side 1

All the images have outlines of couches and television screens. The screens have images of games, and the couches have text.

### Title page
Representation Matters, too

Accessibility isn’t the end of the conversation about disability and videogames.

### Page 1

The image on the screen is a wheelchair in a hallway from Silent Hill. The chair is empty, the room is dirty, and everything has a creepy sepia color scheme.

The text says:
The quintessential image of the wheelchair is perhaps the wheelchairs from horror games like Silent Hill. A haunted wheelchair or a wheelchair with a corpse barrelling toward you is a oft-used jumpscare. Disability and wheelchairs are used as grotesque symbols of fear. When this kind of ableism is the standard, the standard needs to change.


### Page 2

The image on the screen is from Detroit: Become Human. An android is pushing an older man in a sporty chair that looks like it's a carbon fiber/ultralight chair that has cambered wheels and orange accents. It's quite a stylish chair. Both the android (Markus) and the other person (Carl) are white men.

The text says:
Even a game (Detroit: Become Human) that has a character with a sporty, cambered chair doesn’t really get around by himself with it. He has an android push it for him. They got a contemporary, non-medicalized looking chair for a character who wouldn’t choose such a chair. If there was any question about whether this was an intentional choice for some greater symbolism or lazy design, one need only look at the rest of the game, in which the Civil Rights movement is co-opted and appropriated  for a message about android rights in which race is not discussed. It’s a game full of bad takes.

### Page 3

The image on the screen is of a cartoon raccoon in a chef hat using a chair. It is from Overcooked.

The text says: Overcooked’s raccoon character uses a chair, and they’re just as fast and mobile as the other characters. The chair is fairly stylized, but its ‘inaccuracies’ are in line with the style of the rest of the game. Because of the nature of the game, though, the raccoon character doesn’t have much of a personality. We need to see chair users with agency in games with strong narratives.

The last page is just text, and says:

How do we do better?
Spend time with the people you want to depict.
Hire a diverse group of people so they can draw from their own experiences.
Hire disabled people: as consultants, as artists, as developers, as reviewers.
Not just one person at one step of the design, but many people all throughout the process.
Buy a game when you hear it does representation well, and recommend it to others.
We can do better, and we have a responsibility to do so.

## Side 2
The images are a little hand-drawn comic with black outlines and are not in color.
### Title page
Representation Matters, too

When abled people depict us, they shape our worlds.

### Page 1

There's a television screen with an image of an advertisement featuring a boy in a chair.

There's text that says:
I’m Apurva. for a couple years, I needed a wheelchair to get around.  

My family and I would often sit together and either watch me play videogames or watch the news.

at some point, some advertisement came up with a sad little boy in a wheelchair.

### Page 2

Apurva, their father, and another person are all in the image. The father says "Hey, it's Apurva!"


There's text that says:
When my dad saw that little boy in the chair, he had to point it out.

We had a family friend over at the time, and he wasn’t exactly used to this.

### Page 3

The other person (the family friend) has an admonishing look and says "You can’t just say that all people who use wheelchairs are like, the same. "

There's text that says:
But that’s what the media gives us.

The same regurgitated trope-y depictions of people, usually white and usually boys or men.
Repeated ad nauseum.

we are more than that.


### Page 4

The last page just has text that says:

But we are not yet seen.
