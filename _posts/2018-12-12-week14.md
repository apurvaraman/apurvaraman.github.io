# Zines: The Body and Automation
![The "amalgam" zine. The first pages says amalgam, human/machine. The second page has a grayscale illustration of people in business attire. The caption says fig 1, human resources. The second page has an illustration of a green card and the caption says fig 2, alien. The third page has an illustration of a human brain and says fig 3, human capital. The next page says (mechanistic dehumanization). On the reverse side of the zine, the title says amalgam, machine/human. The first page has an illustration of a rifle and says fig 1, arms. the next page has an illustration of a plug and socket and is captioned fig 2., male and female (outlets). The next page has an illustration of a nuclear warhead and is captioned fig 3, (warhead). The last page says (anthropomorphized power). ](https://apurvaraman.github.io/img/amalgam.png)

Zines give me a way to ask questions and communicate my thoughts more effectively. Exploring this medium, especially as a way to make connections between things and communicate those connections beyond just in conversation is something that has a lot of meaning for me.  

I chose to explore the disability space from a personal standpoint as a response to this project (even though its connection to automation is somewhat tenuous) because automation and the body are so deeply linked and disability politics *on its own, on its own merit, without being directly couched in the context of automation* is crucial to understand. Having discussions about structural inequity (when it comes to everything from race to gender to disability) is necessary to even be able to evaluate the effects of automation, AI, and algorithms.

I then chose to further explore the body and technology and the “automation” of human workers- using dehumanizing terms for workers as parts of machines. Our paradigm is such that we define an optimal intelligence as one that is human-like but is built optimizing for efficiency and speed of a machine or computer. We hold people and machines to this standard. Hugh Gusterson, in Nuclear Rites, talks about how when scientists work on weapons technology, they often use humanizing or anthropomorphizing language for their technologies to avoid confronting the implications of violence. When a system can be made more profitable for the privileged few, we use dehumanizing language for the others to reinforce their marginalization.

It became clear to me that I wanted to make more zines but I also wanted these zines to have a digital existence. They need to be well-described and easily readable by a screenreader. The physical existence of these objects is important, but the way in which I’m using theme makes sense for them to be digital. I’m not sure yet where the best place to publish them is- I’ve been looking at comics sites like Tapas, but it’s not quite the right format. I could reasonably have them as a separate site, but I feel like there’s an existing community and platform that it would probably enhance the experience. I think my audience should be much broader than people who will be in the same spaces as me- especially when dealing with disability in gaming, I have access to spaces that a lot of people will not, and I need to reach them if I want to amplify their voices. Keeping a practice like this and working with the medium of zines will help keep me in dialogue with others and not get stuck in the perspective from the software engineering bubble.
